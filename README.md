This repo is a collection of algorithms and tools that I find useful to deal with calculations, forecasting and handling of my assets.
Since I do not have many assets yet (like stocks and such), for now it's just a simple series of algorithms to forecast net worth growth, financial independency, etc.

### Use

Having Python installed in the terminal, the use of these tools is very simple.
Using: 'python -i PF.py' will open the code in your terminal, at which point you can call functions and pass them arguments, like: 'print(timeToBroke(500000, 24000, 0.04))'.
