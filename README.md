This repo is a collection of algorithms and tools that I find useful to deal with calculations, forecasting and handling of my assets.
Since I do not have many assets yet (like stocks and such), for now it's really simple and I am upgrading it from time to time.

### Use

Having Python installed in the terminal, the use of these tools is very simple.

Let's start with PF.py:
Using: 'python -i PF.py' will open the code in your terminal, at which point you can call functions and pass them arguments, like: 'print(timeToBroke(500000, 24000, 0.04))'.

Cashflow.py, instead, is a GUI that allows for simple interaction with a database to keep track of the money spent and earned. I started writing it on the 24th of October, and for now it's still really simple, just a form that you can use to insert a few data like name of the transaction, if the money is spent or earned, type and description, and the amount (there is not even the possibility to add the date LOL). In the future I plan to add features to it, like wealth calculations, graphs and such.
